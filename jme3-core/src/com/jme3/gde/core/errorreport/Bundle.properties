ExceptionPanel.jTextPane1.text=If you can see this, something really bad happened. An Exception has occured in the SDK.\nBut no worries, if you report that error to us, we can have a look at it.\nIt is really simple, all you have to do is have a look at the Error Details and Copy them to the clipboard (using the provided button)\nThen you can click "Open Help in Browser", it will directly take you to either the github issues page for "real" bugs in the SDK or\nto the hub if it looks like a user error where you can ask for help.\nSometimes it's wise to include information from the Graphic Capabilities Tab as that's the features of your GPU,\nbut this is mostly useful to debug errors with the engine itself\nThanks for your help at making the SDK bugfree.
